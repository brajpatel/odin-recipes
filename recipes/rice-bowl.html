                <ol>
                    <li>Wash the rice - put the desired amount of rice in a bowl and fill with some water. Stir the rice with your hands, the water will likely become murky. Drain the water and repeat until the water becomes mostly clear.</li>
                    <li>Place the rice in the pot you'll be cooking it in and add water. A good rule of thumb is to add twice as much water as there is rice (E.g. for 1 cup of rice, add 2 cups water).</li>
                    <li>Allow the rice to soak for approximately 45 minutes to an hour.</li>
                    <li>To start cooking the rice, set the heat to high and bring the water to the boil.</li>
                    <li>Once the water has come to a boil, turn the heat down to medium and let it sit for 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Turn the heat down to low and leave to cook for another 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Then turn the heat off and let it sit for a final 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Lastly, strain the rice, serve and enjoy!</li>
