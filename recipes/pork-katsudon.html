                <h2>Instructions</h2>

                <ol>
                    <li>Heat up some oil in a deep pan - about &frac12; an inch should do.</li>
                    <li>Pound the pork chops with the mallet to about &frac14; of an inch thickness.</li>
                    <li>Season the pork chops well with salt and pepper, and dust them with flour.</li>
                    <li>Dip the pork first in the beaten egg, and then coat with the panko crumbs</li>
                    <li>Once the oil is hot, place the breaded pork in and fry until golden brown on both sides. Once cooked through, set them aside on a paper towel (to absorb the oil).</li>
                    <li>Add the stock, soy sauce, mirin and sugar to a pan (big enough to hold the pork) and bring to a simmer.</li>
                    <li>Add in the onions and cover the pan with a lid.</li>
                    <li>Once the onions are translucent, carefully slice the pork katsu and add them on top of the onions.</li>
                    <li>Beat the remaining two eggs and pour them on top of the pork katsu slices. Cover the pan with the lid</li>
                    <li>Start preparing the bowl by adding the rice</li>
                    <li>Once the eggs are cooked to your liking, pick up the pan and slide/pour the sauce, onions, egg and katsu on top of the rice in the bowl.</li>
                    <li>Top with peas and/or another choice of garnishing and enjoy!</li>
